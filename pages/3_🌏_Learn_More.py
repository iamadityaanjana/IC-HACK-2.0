st.subheader('What exactly is Carbon Footprint?')

st.write("A carbon footprint is a quantification of the total volume of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), and other carbon compounds released directly or indirectly as a result of the actions of an individual, a company, an event, or a product during a specific timeframe. It is usually expressed in units of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), which take into consideration the varying climate-warming potentials of different greenhouse gases.")
st.write("Reducing one's carbon footprint is a vital strategy in combating climate change. This can be achieved through various measures, such as enhancing energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy sources, utilizing public transportation, minimizing waste, adopting sustainable farming practices, and more. Carbon footprint assessments serve as tools to help individuals and organizations identify their primary sources of emissions and make informed choices to reduce their environmental impact")

st.subheader("How harmful it is?")
st.write("The harmful effects of CO2 emissions can be seen in several ways:")
st.write("Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are highly detrimental due to their central role in exacerbating global warming and climate change. CO2, as a greenhouse gas, intensifies the greenhouse effect by trapping heat within the Earth's atmosphere. This, in turn, leads to a range of devastating consequences, including the rise in global temperatures, which fosters more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and extreme weather events, causing havoc for ecosystems, agriculture, and human societies alike. Furthermore, rising temperatures result in the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, contributing to sea-level rise that triggers coastal erosion, heightened flooding, and the displacement of vulnerable coastal communities.")
